            <h3>Carshows</h3>
            <p>Going to carshows and seeing people express themselves through their vehicles is always fun. I'm a huge car geek. I hope I never get tired of apreciating the curves and lines of automobiles and other art on wheels. vehicles will always be visually and audibly stimulating to me.</p>

            <h3>Riding motorcycles</h3>
            <p>There is nothing like riding a motorcycle. Everytime you get to your destination safely you really have a new appriciation for life. Dollar for dollar its hard to beat the acceleration of a motorcycle. The feeling of getting out on a curvy road with no destination is one of the best types of therapy.</p>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>"Here's to the crazy ones, the misfits, the rebels, the troublemakers, the round pegs in the square holes... the ones who see things differently - they're not fond of rules... You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them, but the only thing you can't do is ignore them because they change things... they push the human race forward, and while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius, because the ones who are crazy enough to think that they can change the world, are the ones who do."-Steve Jobs</p>
